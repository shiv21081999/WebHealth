# Predict your Disease with your symptoms

### This project contain a Machine Learning code and a web front page for display, Machine Learning code is written in PYTHON and Web front is written using HTML, JAVASCRIPT, CSS, EXPRESS, NODE

## The front page will look like : starting_page.png (which has been given in appearance_of_web)

### Front_Page:

#### This page is just an introduction page and contain a next button

## The final page will look like : final_page.png (which has been given in appearance_of_web)

### Final Page:

#### This page gives a predicted disease on the bases of symptoms added, gender, age of the person

# Python

### The Machine Learning code is given in folder 'python' in 'route' with the dataset used
